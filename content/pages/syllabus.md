Online Resources
----------------

{{% resource_link "0d059520-5fb6-4b67-bc9d-a44a3c193399" "The Oxford Classical Dictionary" %}}, a scholarly and authoritative encyclopedia of all things ancient Greek and Roman.

{{% resource_link "c621767b-f5b1-4795-9395-d718ad1bab61" "The Loeb Classical Library Online" %}}. The LCL has for generations been the go-to collection for reading English translations of ancient texts alongside the original Greek or Latin. Some of the translations are now quite old and correspondingly stilted; but the collection is comprehensive and reliable.

{{% resource_link "1a7fab05-3408-42d0-887c-83589fe4feaa" "LacusCurtius" %}}. Many of the same texts appear on the LCL site, but here in a format that some will find more user-friendly. Also includes collections of photos of Latin inscriptions and theatres _inter alia_.
